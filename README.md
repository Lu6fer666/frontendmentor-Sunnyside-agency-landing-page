- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: //
- Live Site URL: //

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS using the BEM convention [BEM] (https://getbem.com/introduction/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript basics

### What I learned

I learned how to use SCSS and how to use the BEM convention correctly. 

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT was a great help in making my burger menu (I'd kind of forgotten how to do it). It redirected me to Fonts Awesome, and it was very easy afterwards
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - I always have an MDN page open when I'm coding, so having all the posibilities and descriptions close at hand helps me make my choices.
